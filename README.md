Literary Scholar | PhD, IIT Patna  
Transitioning into Digital Humanities & Scholarly Text Encoding  

I work at the intersection of literature and structured text.  
Currently developing skills in TEI P5, XSLT, and RDF to build digital scholarly editions and interoperable research outputs.

My recent work includes encoding selections from Voltaire’s *Candide* using TEI and transforming them into HTML and RDF formats.
