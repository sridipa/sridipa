PhD, Indian Institute of Technology Patna · Executive Editor, Edinburgh University Press

Researcher and editorial professional working at the intersection of literary scholarship and digital humanities. My work spans TEI-encoded scholarly editions, XSLT transformation pipelines, and RDF metadata resources on one hand, and multimodal and computational analysis of digital children's literature archives from the Global South on the other. I am interested in how digital infrastructure shapes access to knowledge, across Enlightenment studies, gender studies, and postcolonial children's literature.
